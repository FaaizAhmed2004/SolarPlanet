# Font and Card Size Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the need to systematically reduce font sizes and card dimensions across the entire website to improve visual hierarchy, content density, and overall user experience. The current implementation has oversized fonts and cards that make the website appear cluttered and reduce content efficiency.

## Requirements

2. WHEN viewing headings THEN h1 SHALL be reduced by one size level (e.g., text-4xl → text-3xl)
3. WHEN viewing headings THEN h2 SHALL be reduced by one size level (e.g., text-3xl → text-2xl)
4. WHEN viewing headings THEN h3 SHALL be reduced by one size level (e.g., text-2xl → text-xl)
5. WHEN viewing paragraph text THEN it SHALL use text-sm as the base size instead of text-base

7. WHEN viewing footer content THEN all text SHALL be reduced to text-xs/text-sm range

### Requirement 2: Card Component Size Optimization

4. WHEN viewing card spacing THEN gaps between cards SHALL be reduced by 25%
5. WHEN viewing card heights THEN they SHALL be more compact while maintaining readability
6. WHEN viewing card images THEN they SHALL be proportionally smaller to match reduced card sizes

### Requirement 3: Page-Specific Optimizations

**User Story:** As a website visitor browsing specific pages like Electrify Home and Heat Pumps, I want the content to be well-organized and not overwhelming in size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Electrify Home page THEN all service cards SHALL be reduced in size by 30%
2. WHEN viewing the Heat Pumps page THEN product cards SHALL use compact layouts
3. WHEN viewing the Residential Solar page THEN feature cards SHALL be optimized for content density
4. WHEN viewing the Commercial Solar page THEN case study cards SHALL be more compact
5. WHEN viewing any product page THEN specification tables SHALL use smaller fonts
6. WHEN viewing testimonial sections THEN quote cards SHALL be more compact

### Requirement 4: Responsive Design Consistency
